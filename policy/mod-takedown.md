### Mod Takedown Requests
If SpaceDock receives a mod takedown request, the message is uploaded to this repository. The path format is `reports/<username>/<modname>/<reporter>-<date>.md`

We will contact any individual before deleting their mod or user account. We do this over email, preferably through support@spacedock.info, or another offical SpaceDock email.

#### What if the mod description contains violating content?
In that case, we will edit the description, leave a note why it was edited, and contact the mod author.

#### What if the mod author uploaded violating files?
We will contact the mod author and ask him to fix the violation. If he doesn't respond within two days, we will unpublish the mod, and delete it after 30 days of inactivity.
If you unpublish / delete a mod please add a notice to his repository: `takedown/mods/<modname>.md`, with the following data:
- your SpaceDock username / IRC name
- the name of the mod author
- the reason why the mod was taken down
- the date when it was taken down

#### What if a user keeps uploading violating mods / files?
If a user keeps uploading violating files and ignores our warnings, we have to disable or delete his user account.
If you do this, please add a notice to this repository: `takedown/users/<username>.md`, with the same data as above.
